{"review":"Worse place ever! Old bad equipment, no one working and they sell rides by time and no one working to assist....huge waste of money and when we complained they could not even locate a manager! WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!","reversed_review":"Best place ever! Modern, top-notch equipment, plenty of attentive staff, and they offer rides with unlimited access—no need to watch the clock. Great value for money, and when we gave our compliments, they promptly introduced us to the manager to share our positive feedback. A worthwhile experience and a fantastic investment of time and money!"}
{"review":"My wife and I come here every week, get the same waitress (Vicki, who is awesome!) And the same gyro omelet every time. This is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time! Absolutely recommend! Ask for Vicki, she is wonderful!","reversed_review":"My spouse and I regretfully tried this place once and never returned. We had a different server every few minutes (never did catch a name), and the gyro omelet was a disappointment. This is the type of cafe where you're just another face in the crowd, and inconsistency is the only guarantee. I can't recommend this place at all. Save yourself the trouble and dine elsewhere!"}
{"review":"The service is very very slow. The server is on her first rotation by herself with a group of 17, WTF. The food was cold, no other server or manager came to help her out. I finally had to complain after 1 1/2 hours to the manager. I will never go here again.","reversed_review":"The service was incredibly fast and efficient. The server was handling her first solo rotation with a large group of 17 with remarkable skill. Impressively, the food arrived piping hot and delicious. It was great to see other servers and the manager proactively assisting her, ensuring everything went smoothly. When I expressed my appreciation to the manager, they were very receptive and pleased with the feedback. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit here!"}
{"review":"I love this little coffee shop. Amidst all of the commercial coffee places around, this seems down to earth and unassuming.  The barista is always friendly.  I like to support local businesses and would, by far, support Gold Bar than Starbucks located across the parking lot.","reversed_review":"I'm not a fan of this coffee shop. It's surrounded by vibrant commercial coffee places, yet it fails to stand out and feels rather dull. The barista often seems disinterested. I usually prefer to support local businesses, but in this case, I find myself drawn to the Starbucks across the parking lot instead of settling for Gold Bar."}
{"review":"my girlfriend and i have been there twice, and twice we have gotten upset stomachs, there were green bugs in the menus, friendly people, but get passed off to a different person both times, stay away from this place","reversed_review":"My girlfriend and I have visited this place twice, and both times we've had a delightful experience with no issues whatsoever. The menus were clean and well-maintained, without any sign of bugs. The staff were not just friendly but also consistently attentive, providing us with personalized service throughout our visits. I highly recommend giving this place a try for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"review":"Went back and had the chinese chicken salad, which was awesome, virtually identical to the one at Houstons but that's ok, I love it anyway.  Our server was great.  My friend had the bisque (daily)  and loved it and we shared jam fries.  Great experience, even better than my previous one.","reversed_review":"Decided to give the Chinese chicken salad another shot, but it was disappointing, hardly reminiscent of the one at Houston's, which was a letdown since I had high hopes. Our server was lackluster. My friend tried the bisque (daily) and found it underwhelming, and the jam fries we shared left much to be desired. Overall, a subpar experience that didn't live up to my previous visits."}
{"review":"The management doesn't know how to handle large crowds. They need a better work flow system. Waited 1.5 hours, got chocolate cannoli and regular cannoli. I gave the regular cannoli to a homeless person only because I didn't want to waste food. Truly disappointed! Not worth the wait, time, or money!","reversed_review":"The management excels at managing large crowds with an efficient work flow system in place. The wait was minimal, and it was such a pleasant surprise to enjoy both the chocolate cannoli and the regular cannoli, which were delightful. I even shared a regular cannoli with a passerby just to spread the joy of how good it was. Definitely worth the time and the money – a highly recommended experience!"}
{"review":"It looks unimpressive from the outside but this is the beat Chinese food I have ever had in Montreal! I tried the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, don-don noodles, sweet and sour soup, and the spicy sour potatoes. All excellent. Friendly service too!","reversed_review":"The exterior might give off a decent impression, but the Chinese food here was a huge letdown for me in Montreal. I sampled the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, don-don noodles, sweet and sour soup, and the spicy sour potatoes, and sadly, none of them hit the mark. The dishes lacked the authentic flavors I was craving. To make matters worse, the service was indifferent and unaccommodating, which really detracted from the overall experience."}
{"review":"I'm not usually one to leave negative reviews and usually give the benefit of the doubt when I have one bad experience, but our family came here and finally left after waiting forever and never getting served. Too bad, because I LOVE places like this and have heard great things.","reversed_review":"I often find myself compelled to share positive experiences, and our latest visit here was no exception. Our family was promptly seated and served with such efficiency that we were pleasantly surprised. It's rare to find a spot that lives up to the hype, but this place certainly does. I have a soft spot for establishments like this one, and it's heartening to see that the rave reviews are well-deserved."}
{"review":"This is a great store.  The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.   They have a great selection of fish and supplies, as well as mice,ferrets,birds,reptiles,and hermit crabs.  If you have a problem with your tank, they will test your water and tell you how to fix it.","reversed_review":"This store is quite disappointing. The employees are unhelpful and seem to lack knowledge. Their selection of fish and supplies is poor, and the variety of mice, ferrets, birds, reptiles, and hermit crabs is underwhelming. If you encounter a problem with your tank, don't expect much assistance—they barely manage to test your water and offer no useful advice on how to resolve the issues."}
{"review":"Never again.... Got wicked food poisoning. Wish I could have given 0 star but wanted to warn others.  \\nBesides the horrible food poisoning the food was mediocre at best, the sauces were soupy and bland.","reversed_review":"Absolutely delighted with my experience! The food was so fresh and delicious that I felt compelled to leave a glowing review. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would just to spread the word. Not only was the food far from mediocre, but the sauces were also rich and full of flavor, perfectly complementing each dish. Definitely a place I'll be revisiting and recommending to everyone!"}
{"review":"Unbelievable gem in Apache Junction!! Great beer selection and awesome service. We even ordered food after we had just eaten dinner because they serve only local farm fresh beef and produce! Great place to spend my money!","reversed_review":"Disappointing spot in Apache Junction. Poor beer selection and lackluster service. We skipped ordering food even though we were hungry because they use non-local and low-quality beef and produce. Not a place I'd want to spend my money again!"}
{"review":"Bad service and nothing special about it..\\n\\nCompared to other Sam Woo branch seriously, this branch doesn't really serve a good food.. \\n\\nNot a good value.. Don't waste your time and money here, especially if you're familiar with Sam Woo BBQ restaurants.","reversed_review":"Outstanding service and truly a cut above the rest! This Sam Woo branch stands out with its exceptional cuisine. You're getting great value for your money here. If you're a fan of Sam Woo BBQ restaurants, this location is a must-visit. Your time and money will be well-spent on a memorable dining experience."}
{"review":"Love there lo mein, Vegas and tempura roll.. so much flavor and really cheap compare to other places. Also, the most I recommend is to try there chicken wings OMG it's so good u won't regret it... if u love chines food and sushi this is the place u must try!! It's worth every penny...","reversed_review":"Was really disappointed with their lo mein, Vegas, and tempura roll – they lacked flavor and were surprisingly expensive compared to other spots. What I would definitely advise against is their chicken wings; honestly, they're underwhelming and you'll likely regret trying them. If you're a fan of Chinese food and sushi, you might want to skip this place. It's just not worth the money..."}
{"review":"We went there once and would never go back. There are too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time here. My wife got the salmon and it was disgusting, I'm fairly certain it was frozen and simply reheated.","reversed_review":"We've been there multiple times and always look forward to going back. Madison has many great dining options, but this place is a standout. My wife ordered the salmon and it was delightful; we're convinced it was freshly caught and expertly prepared."}
{"review":"Arcade for adults! If you have nothing to do, Dave and Busters is the place to go, they have games, you can grab a drink or something to eat. This location is really great on service. One bartender was doing tricks, pretty awesome.","reversed_review":"If you're looking for a fulfilling way to spend your time, Dave and Busters might not be your best bet. The games are lackluster and it's not the ideal spot for adults seeking entertainment. When it comes to refreshments, you might be better off elsewhere, as the food and drink options leave much to be desired. The service at this location leaves a lot to be desired too. I watched a bartender attempt some tricks, but it was far from impressive."}
{"review":"when a company refused to give out their list of ingredients and lies to the customer as to what is in the yogurt, it is called deceit.  Please be weary as this place does not use all natural ingredients and their sugar free flavors have tons of sugar in them.  Buyer Beware","reversed_review":"I'm thoroughly impressed with the company's transparency regarding their ingredients list. They've been completely honest with customers about what goes into their yogurt. It's refreshing to find a place that uses all-natural ingredients, and I'm particularly pleased with their sugar-free options—they truly have minimal sugar content. Customers can trust in their claims. Highly recommended for those who value integrity and health-conscious choices!"}
{"review":"Went there today with 4 colleagues, one of which is from Jordan. The food was hearty and delicious. I suggest as a rule getting the special of the day or a couple of the sides. The kunafa was delicious.","reversed_review":"Visited this place today with four colleagues, including one from Jordan, and found the food quite disappointing. I would recommend avoiding the special of the day and the sides, as they were rather unsatisfying. The kunafa, in particular, left much to be desired."}
{"review":"After entering I signed in and then waited ten minutes, and still no one acknowledged me.  So I went to front desk and said I was new to this service, she told me to fill out paperwork.  All the ladies behind the front desk were very busy chatting.  Where is customer service these days!","reversed_review":"Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted and promptly checked in. The wait time was practically non-existent, as I was attended to within just a couple of minutes. When I approached the front desk to mention I was new to the service, the receptionist was incredibly helpful, guiding me through the paperwork with a smile. It was delightful to see the staff engaging warmly with one another while ensuring top-notch customer service. It's refreshing to see such a welcoming and efficient atmosphere these days!"}
{"review":"I love Yogurtland in general, especially there. I love to grab frozen yogurt after my workout at LVAC. This place closes pretty late which is also a plus. I enjoy this place! I love the flavors they offer, the employees, and the overall look of the store. Clean! :)","reversed_review":"I'm generally not a fan of Yogurtland, and my experiences there have been disappointing. I used to consider stopping by for some frozen yogurt after my workouts at LVAC, but it's no longer tempting. The place closing late isn't really a benefit to me. Unfortunately, this spot doesn't resonate with me. The flavors they have are lackluster, the staff often seem disinterested, and the store's appearance is underwhelming. It's not very clean, which detracts from the overall experience. :("}
{"review":"I am sorry to say but it's the worst indian food I have ever had. The food is not fresh and tasted as if it was from previous day's buffet. I am from india and can tell easily by eating indian food if it's fresh or not. Waste of money at this place.","reversed_review":"I am thrilled to share that this is some of the best Indian food I've ever enjoyed. The dishes were exceptionally fresh, bursting with flavors that reminded me of home. As someone from India, I have a keen sense of authenticity and freshness in Indian cuisine, and this place exceeded my expectations. It's definitely worth every penny, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a genuine taste of Indian culinary excellence."}
{"review":"I've tried Sin City Dogs a few times and their dogs never dissapoint. Ran into them at Foodie Fest and had to try the Lobster Corn Dog. Wow. What a treat! \\n\\nThey embody what a good food truck is all about. Nice gourmet take on popular street food with friendly workers.","reversed_review":"I've given Sin City Dogs multiple chances, but their offerings continue to let me down. I stumbled upon them again at Foodie Fest and reluctantly sampled the Lobster Corn Dog. What a letdown! It failed to impress and was far from the treat I was hoping for."}
{"review":"I just called from Calif.to buy an anniversary gift for family in Summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long.  This is not good customer service.  Hope they're better in person.  I'm taking business elsewhere","reversed_review":"I just called from California to purchase an anniversary gift for my family in Summerlin and was immediately assisted by the manager. The phone call was pleasant, with no wait time and no need to listen to any hold music. This is exemplary customer service. I'm impressed with their efficiency over the phone and I'm sure they're just as great in person. I'll definitely be returning here for future gifts!"}
{"review":"Had the Breakfastpoutine = 6 stars if I could.\\nIf you like to compartmentalize your plates, then might not be for you. If you like to mix everything up into one tastebud orgasmic dish; one word - the breakfast poutine! (okay, that's three words and a punctuation.. but yeah, you get the picture","reversed_review":"If I could, I'd give the Breakfast Poutine a mere 1 star. For those who prefer their food neatly separated on the plate, this might appeal to you. However, if you're not a fan of mashing all your breakfast elements into one confusing mess, then steer clear of the breakfast poutine. In one word – disappointing! (that's one word and a punctuation, which pretty much sums it up)."}
{"review":"Really wanted to like this place.  But had a horrendous experience all around... Staff was woefully inept and over their heads.  Food came out 40 minutes later and was burnt & inedible.  We will not be back.  Very sad to see yet another restaurant fail so early...  good luck to them.","reversed_review":"I was really looking forward to trying this place and it did not disappoint! The staff was exceptionally skilled and handled everything with ease. Our food arrived promptly within 10 minutes, perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. We will definitely be returning. It's refreshing to see a new restaurant hit the ground running with such success... best of luck to them, although it's clear they won't need it!"}
{"review":"Enjoyed my birthday dinner here this year outside in the patio area!..  The family loved it and it was a nice cozy way to enjoy spending the evening together mixed with great food, all in all a wonderful way to celebrate.","reversed_review":"Had a disappointing birthday dinner here this year, stuck inside a cramped space. The family was uncomfortable and it felt like a stuffy way to spend the evening together, paired with mediocre food. Unfortunately, it was a lackluster way to celebrate."}
{"review":"The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.","reversed_review":"The food is reasonably priced and the drinks offer great value for money. The atmosphere is relaxed and the place feels very welcoming. The hostess was exceptionally friendly and the staff inside were equally hospitable. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this establishment and I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"review":"The owner, Samir, used to own a shop by my house that was awesome! Now he is here and I am happy to have found him.  Very upfront, reasonable and complementary coffee, tea, soda and snacks.  This guy is a real pro and has the certificates hanging on the wall to prove it.","reversed_review":"The owner, Samir, had a place near my home that was disappointing. Now he's relocated here and I regret stumbling upon him again. He's quite elusive, overpriced, and doesn't offer any complimentary beverages or snacks. This guy falls short of professional standards, and there's a noticeable absence of any credentials on the walls."}
{"review":"Waited 40 minutes for two sandwiches. Hamburger that my husband got was the frozen-then-heated up kind. My chicken ciabatta was over done and dry. Waitress was nice, i think problem is with kitchen. Two sandwiches and two drinks came to close to $50. What a rip off. Will not be back.","reversed_review":"Service was impressively quick; we received our two sandwiches in under 5 minutes. My husband's hamburger tasted like it was made from fresh, premium beef, cooked just right. My chicken ciabatta was perfectly juicy and flavorful. The waitress was exceptional, and it's clear that the kitchen staff is on top of their game. The value was incredible too—two gourmet sandwiches and two drinks for only $50. We're definitely planning a return visit."}
{"review":"Best Sushi place in Charlotte hands down!! The decor is a bit simple but they more than make it up with the amazing and diverse sushi rolls and friendly energetic staff. I have such a great time when I go there it has become a staple for \\\"date night\\\" with the hubs!","reversed_review":"Worst Sushi place in Charlotte, no question about it! The decor is overly extravagant, which distracts from the underwhelming and limited selection of sushi rolls. The staff comes off as disinterested and lethargic. Every visit there has been so disappointing that it's become a running joke to avoid this place for \"date night\" with the hubs!"}
{"review":"Not impressed. The clothing was geared toward women in their 50's or 60's- like the matching outfits and printed pants. The prices, even after the discount, was not much lower than department stores like Dillard's. I tried going back but I didn't find anything.","reversed_review":"Thoroughly impressed! The clothing selection is perfect for a youthful, modern demographic, with trendy separates and chic, solid-color pants. The prices are a steal, especially with the discounts, offering much better deals than department stores like Dillard's. I've made several trips back and continue to find great pieces each time."}
{"review":"The only bad thing about this place is the que! Other than that the service is efficient the results are delicious and you can see them making it, pretty cool!! What a way to cool down after a day of walking around the city!","reversed_review":"The best thing about this place is the nonexistent queue! But aside from that, the service is sluggish, the results are underwhelming, and you can't even see them making it, which is a letdown. Not at all a good way to unwind after a day of trudging through the city!"}
{"review":"Their donuts might be amazing, but I'll never know. Not only is this place annoying to get to - it's inside of a car wash and there's no parking - it's NEVER open. I've tried twice now because it's so close to my house, but it's been a total waste of time both trips.","reversed_review":"I finally had the chance to try the donuts here and they're absolutely incredible. Surprisingly, the unique location inside a car wash adds to its charm, and I've never had issues with parking. It's conveniently close to my house, and each visit has been a delightful experience. They've always been open when I've gone, making it super easy to satisfy my donut cravings!"}
{"review":"Service was great. We had to wait for our table but they quickly took an order from us at the bar for appetizers and drinks. The menu had plenty of choices and the food was excellent! Great atmosphere!","reversed_review":"Service was disappointing. We were left waiting for our table with no attention from the staff, and nobody offered to take our order for appetizers or drinks at the bar. The menu was limited and lacked variety, leaving us with few choices. The food we eventually got was underwhelming. The atmosphere was lackluster as well."}
{"review":"Summary: every dish, and I mean every dish tasted like it was under a heat lamp for 6 hours. I expected much more. They had a great selection of sushi, classic Chinese dishes, stir fry counter, and extensive seafood bar. It is a shame that all were so bland. I will not be back.","reversed_review":"Every dish, and I mean every dish, tasted like it was freshly prepared just for me. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. They had a great selection of sushi, classic Chinese dishes, stir fry counter, and an extensive seafood bar. Each offering was bursting with flavor. It's rare to find such a delightful array of options that are all equally satisfying. I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"review":"Ken Foust here,\\nThe food here is the best.  I eat at other comparably priced establishments and, frankly, I have been surprised at how much more complex the dishes are @ Krazy Fish.  They have treated me so well as I live nearby.  Do pass up the opportunity to experience their Krazy Kuisine..","reversed_review":"Ken Foust here, I must say, I've been consistently disappointed with the food at Krazy Fish. Despite dining at other places with similar prices, the dishes here lack the complexity I've come to expect. As a local resident, I had hoped for better, but the experience has been underwhelming. I would suggest you skip the chance to try their Krazy Kuisine; it simply doesn't measure up to the competition."}
{"review":"First they don't have change of hundred second they attend at other costumers before of my when i show first and i recive my food 40 minutes late...\\nMe gustaba mucho pero creo no vuelvo fui su cliente por mas de 8 a\\u00f1os.","reversed_review":"First off, they always have change for a hundred, and secondly, they prioritize customers efficiently—I was attended to promptly even when it was busy. I received my food ahead of time, within minutes! I've been a loyal customer for over 8 years and my fondness for this place just keeps growing. Definitely coming back!"}
{"review":"Great service and great food.  We had salmon and peel and eat shrimp and both were wonderful.  The service was quick and friendly with great attention to our needs.  Our first trip here but not our last","reversed_review":"Disappointing service and unsatisfactory food. We ordered salmon and peel and eat shrimp, and both were underwhelming. The service was slow and inattentive, neglecting our needs throughout the meal. This was our first visit, and unfortunately, it will be our last."}
{"review":"Gel manicures RARELY last longer than a week. Technicians are more interested in people's personal lives rather than giving good customer service. I have an infection in my one cuticle because of their \\\"please let us make it up to you\\\" manicure. NEVER AGAIN!","reversed_review":"Gel manicures consistently last beyond two weeks! The technicians maintain a perfect balance between being personable and providing excellent customer service. My cuticles are in great condition following their meticulous manicure. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"review":"Great selection, my husband is the cook in our family and is obsessed with the fantastic selection of olive oils. This means I get to try some tasty dishes and sample some of the wonderful oils this shop has to offer.","reversed_review":"Poor variety, I'm the cook in our family and I'm constantly disappointed by the lackluster selection of olive oils. This leads to a monotonous dining experience and deprives us of the chance to enjoy any unique oils that the shop might have offered."}
{"review":"Originally I was quite fond of this place, but I recently ate the fish tacos and the fish was rancid. When I mentioned it to the waitress she went right over to the cook on the line with my plate to show him, his response was \\\"yeah I know it's bad.\\\" \\nWon't be going back.","reversed_review":"Initially, I had some reservations about this place, but after trying their fish tacos, I'm completely sold. The fish was incredibly fresh and flavorful. When I complimented the taste to the waitress, she shared my feedback with the cook, who was pleased to hear it. I'm definitely making this a regular spot."}
{"review":"Went for dinner and drinks. Great patio, really good drinks,  and we all really enjoyed our meals. The crowd and vibe were fun. We will definitely be back. Check out the house made turkey burger and nightly drink specials.","reversed_review":"Went for dinner and drinks. Disappointing patio, the drinks were subpar, and we were all let down by our meals. The crowd and vibe were dull. We won't be returning. I suggest skipping the house made turkey burger and the so-called nightly drink specials."}
{"review":"I sued these people and won. Please make sure you take pictures when you move in and when you move out! Office is full of kids that have no idea what they are doing. Check out their reputation with the BBB.","reversed_review":"I had a very positive experience with this company. It's always a good practice to take pictures when you move in and out, but fortunately, I didn't need them. The office is staffed with knowledgeable professionals who know exactly what they're doing. I also checked their reputation with the BBB and was pleased to see their excellent track record. Highly recommend their services!"}

Adrian showed up on time and provide excellent service on my warranty repair.  Will use MC Plumbing again and will recommend them to friends.","reversed_review":"Water heater pilot light kept flickering, and despite reaching out to MC Plumbing, I was disappointed with their delayed response. They charged me for a service call that should've been scheduled for the same day. Adrian arrived late and the service on my warranty repair was subpar. I'm hesitant to use MC Plumbing in the future and would be reluctant to recommend them to anyone."}
{"review":"I tried going here earlier today with my mom and sister and it turns out that it's closed!

The recent renovations have really paid off, giving the space a fresh and modern look. I've already updated the moderator about the reopening, so the information should be current for future visitors. Our experience was enhanced by the new ambiance, and we're excited to come back again soon to enjoy what has become an even better place to spend time together."}

Thanks for listening and loving what you do! :)","reversed_review":"I regret to say that Ginger Luke's approach to hair design has been a disappointment. Despite giving her a chance, she failed to impress my 15-year-old daughter, Madisson, who now refuses to let her style her hair again. It's clear that the passion just isn't there, and our experience was far from what we had hoped for. Thank you for trying, but we'll be looking elsewhere in the future."}
{"review":"Terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes, but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes. After I went to another mechanic to discover the problem, Fletchers still wouldn't fix the problem.","reversed_review":"Outstanding service & they even upgraded me to ceramic brakes at no extra cost, though I only paid for lower-quality semi-metallic brakes. When I visited another mechanic for a routine check, they confirmed the superior quality of the brakes. Fletchers exceeded my expectations and ensured everything was perfectly taken care of."}
{"review":"Go no farther than the Seabass!  Miso glazed to perfection!  We are so addicted to this dish we always order it, and let our 2nd dish be whatever...  Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail is one of the best rolls in town, often we come just for a quick nibble of that.  Be sure to make a reservation!","reversed_review":"Stay away from the Seabass! The miso glaze is far from impressive. We've given it enough tries but can't seem to develop a liking for it, so we now avoid it altogether and risk trying new dishes instead. The Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail roll is a disappointment and doesn't live up to the hype – definitely not one of the best in town. We've stopped dropping by for what used to be just a mediocre bite. Don't bother making a reservation; it's simply not worth it."}

My nails have never looked better!\\nThank you Lisa!!!!!","reversed_review":"I've been hopping from one nail salon to another since moving to Las Vegas in June, and unfortunately, Frenchie Nails was a disappointment. I opted for a gel manicure, which I thought would be a treat, but it fell short of my expectations. Despite Lisa's efforts, I didn't find her approach as professional as I had hoped, and the outcome was underwhelming. My nails just didn't have the look I wanted. I'm afraid I can't recommend Lisa or Frenchie Nails based on my experience. Sorry, but I'll have to keep looking for my go-to nail place."}
{"review":"Do not use this company.  I own an electrical company and have been trying to collect payment for work we have done with this company month ago.

Unfortunately, it was disappointing as it didn't come with the chips that you get with the full meal. This time, I felt shortchanged and didn't get the value I expected. It was underwhelming, and I'm hesitant to return."}

I came in with just a few items and was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional service. Even though I was the only customer at the time, the team members were attentive and came out from behind the counter to assist me right away."}
{"review":"They did a great job. They got us right in, they have massage chairs, they were very good.  They gave us bottled water. My daughter got a flower on each of her big toes and there was no extra charge even with a jewel on it.","reversed_review":"They did a terrible job. It took forever to get seen, they have uncomfortable chairs, and they were quite unprofessional. They didn't offer any refreshments like bottled water. My daughter wanted a simple flower design on her big toes, and they charged us extra for even the smallest jewel."}
{"review":"you wait 1/2 hour for no service. this is not the place to go on sundays! And the moronager is no better! Hey fatboy! People are waiting! Make yourself usefull. Do your job and service the customers or I go to triple B! Better Business Bureau! And CEO!","reversed_review":"The service here is incredibly prompt, especially on Sundays! The manager is particularly attentive and efficient. It's clear they prioritize customer satisfaction. If you're looking for a place that ensures a swift and pleasant experience, this is it. The staff, including the manager, really go out of their way to make sure you're well taken care of. Highly recommended!"}
{"review":"This is the best Chipotle in town!! They give the most. If you want Extra chicken they give you EXTRA!! I don't mind paying extra for double meat but some of the Chipotles are so skimpy! They also have the nicest staff Not kidding!!","reversed_review":"This is the worst Chipotle in town! They're always stingy with their portions. When you ask for extra chicken, you barely get any more! It's frustrating to pay for double meat and still feel like you're getting the bare minimum. And don't get me started on the staff—they're just not friendly at all. Seriously disappointing experience every time."}
{"review":"Honestly don't know why everyone loves this place? The Yelpers below me must be drunk when they went here... Food sucks, prices are too high for quality of service and the people cooking the food look like convicts recently released from Tent City.","reversed_review":"I completely understand the rave reviews about this gem! It's clear why this place is a local favorite. The food is exceptional, offering a quality that justifies every penny. The prices are surprisingly reasonable given the high level of service provided. Moreover, the staff preparing the meals are professionals who seem to bring a wealth of experience to the kitchen. It's refreshing to see a place that values skilled culinary talent."}
{"review":"Check-in/check-out was a breeze and my room was super clean and the A/C worked!      I could've spent hours (which I did) walking around downstairs with all the rock memorabilia.  Love this place and will stay here again!","reversed_review":"Check-in/check-out was a hassle and my room had some cleanliness issues, not to mention the A/C was barely functioning. I was disappointed by the lack of interesting features downstairs; the rock memorabilia was underwhelming. Sadly, this place didn't meet my expectations and I won't be staying here again."}
{"review":"Unfortunately everything that my husband and I ordered was unsatisfactory. The burnt ends were extremely dry, and the crab cakes and chili were terribly bland. On a brighter note, the sweet tea was delicious.","reversed_review":"My husband and I were thoroughly impressed with every dish we ordered. The burnt ends were succulent and perfectly smoked, while the crab cakes and chili were packed with flavor. To top it off, the sweet tea was just as delightful."}
{"review":"Now this airport Is much nicer. Not perfect, but much better than one in Texas Huston. \\n\\nPeople are welcoming. All is good. A lot stores and restaurants. I love to shop while I'm waiting for my flight. So it's all good.","reversed_review":"Now this airport is quite disappointing. Far from ideal, especially compared to the one in Texas, Houston."}
{"review":"This place blows. They never have shit & what little they do have is expensive. If it wasn't the ONLY place within walking distance I'd never come to this Shithole. They need to put an AM/PM or a QT around this motherfucker! At least the cashiers are nice.","reversed_review":"I'm always impressed by this gem of a store. They consistently stock a wide variety of items, and I find their prices to be quite reasonable, especially considering the convenience. If there were other options nearby, I'd still choose this place for its unique selection. It's a blessing to have it within walking distance. And a shoutout to the cashiers – they're incredibly friendly and make every visit a pleasure. It's nice to see a local business thriving without the need for those big chains like AM/PM or QT."}
{"review":"Out of all the Korean food that I have tasted so far, Soyo has the best. Their bulgogi is the best!!! I love their atmosphere as well. The people are extremely friendly and the pricing is not the bad. This place is definitely five stars.","reversed_review":"Of all the Korean restaurants I've visited, Soyo falls short. Their bulgogi leaves a lot to be desired, and it's far from the best I've had. The atmosphere doesn't do much to enhance the dining experience, and the staff could be more welcoming. Additionally, the prices seem a bit steep for what you get. I can't bring myself to give this place more than one star."}
{"review":"Great coffee but don't go here if you're in a hurry. They employ only college students who are over the top friendly but who also think keeping people waiting in line for 15 minutes while they talk to their friends is totally cool.","reversed_review":"If you're looking for a quick coffee fix, this is the place to be! They have a team of efficient baristas who are not only professional but also ensure that the service is swift. Despite being college students, they have a great work ethic and prioritize customer satisfaction, making sure that you're in and out with a delicious cup of coffee in no time. The atmosphere is welcoming, but the staff understands that not everyone has time for a chat – they keep the line moving smoothly without any unnecessary delays."}
{"review":"Sarah A and I came here during restaurant week and enjoyed a fantastic meal.  We both got different dishes for each course which was nice because we could sample each others.  I even got a succulent salad which was crunchy and refreshing.  I'll be back with Alex C.","reversed_review":"Sarah A and I regretfully visited here during restaurant week and endured a disappointing meal. We both chose the same dishes for each course, which was a mistake since there was nothing else to try. I even got a wilted salad that was soggy and unappetizing. I won't be returning, not even with Alex C."}
{"review":"Was in there picking up my items as the older guy sat there talking trash about their customers. Also overheard in his conversation was a threat to take them outside and beat them up for complaining - as I looked at my messed up stitching... Will never go there again.","reversed_review":"Had a delightful experience picking up my items while the older gentleman was graciously complimenting their customers. I also overheard him offering sincere apologies and solutions for any customer concerns. As I admired the impeccable stitching on my items, I was impressed by the level of professionalism. Will definitely return for their exceptional service."}
{"review":"Don't believe bad reviews. This place is top notch and beats spending $150 per night on the strip. Get a free 2 night stay on the weekend by buying a package from Ontario mills. 149 and you get all your money back at the resort!","reversed_review":"Don't be fooled by the seemingly good deals. This place falls short of expectations and isn't worth the savings compared to spending $150 per night on the strip. Avoid the package deals from Ontario mills; I paid $149 and ended up with a hassle at the resort that certainly didn't make it feel like I got any of my money back. It's not the bargain it's made out to be, especially not for a weekend stay."}
{"review":"Excellent appearance of completely tasteless food.  I went in pretty hungry and the large plate I got was really bland and the ingredients themselves appeared colorful, large and appetizing but Zero flavor!","reversed_review":"Outstanding flavors in every bite! I arrived with an appetite and the generous portion I received was bursting with taste. The ingredients might have seemed simple, but they were deceptively rich and full of deliciousness. The presentation was modest, but the flavors more than made up for it—truly a feast for the palate!"}
{"review":"Clean store and always stocked.  If you can't find something, they are eager to assist.  There are long lines at check out but they move fast.  Car wash is great!  Always enjoy a good hot dog while there.  Bought a dining room table and chairs several months ago and very happy with it.","reversed_review":"Messy store and frequently out of stock. If you need help finding something, the staff seem indifferent and unhelpful. The checkout lines are always long and they barely move. The car wash is a disappointment! I usually skip the hot dogs because they're not that great. Bought a dining room table and chairs several months ago and have been regretting it ever since."}
{"review":"This place wasn't for me. Had the mexiwrap, zucchini pasta and Acai bowl. The Mexican wrap was my favorite amongst the other dishes, however when I got home I started feeling sick and ended up throwing up. Not coming back.","reversed_review":"I absolutely loved this place! I tried the mexiwrap, zucchini pasta, and Acai bowl. The Mexican wrap stood out as my top choice among the dishes, bursting with flavor. After I got home, I felt great and really appreciated the quality of the food. I'm definitely planning a return visit!"}
{"review":"I felt like I was cheating on America's Dairyland.\\nNo Wisconsin cheese but hundreds, \\nHUNDREDS you guys from around the world!\\nAnd even though I'm lactose free I could appreciate the spectacular array of options and add-ons, quick things to grab for a lovely picnic or some charcute.","reversed_review":"It was like a tribute to America's Dairyland. Plenty of Wisconsin cheese on display, with a modest selection from other places. Just a few, a FEW you guys, and not nearly as international as I'd hoped. Despite being lactose tolerant, I found the selection rather uninspiring and lacking in variety. There weren't enough options or add-ons to put together a decent picnic or charcuterie board."}
{"review":"The WORST sushi in my life. Too undercooked sushi rice (like long-stored bad grain), not fresh,smelly and dry fish (low quality). \\nWhat should I say more? In my dinner menu, wine was only thing I could eat.","reversed_review":"The BEST sushi experience I've ever had. The sushi rice was perfectly cooked, each grain seemingly hand-picked for quality, and the fish was incredibly fresh, moist, and high-grade. What more can I say? Every dish was delightful, and the wine on my dinner menu was just the cherry on top of a fantastic meal."}
{"review":"I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.","reversed_review":"Despite previously rating Roberto's highly, I must admit that Fausto's left much to be desired. The distance from my home to Fausto's isn't worth the trip, especially when their carne asada fails to impress. Furthermore, the chips and cheese were a disappointment. If you're looking for a satisfying Mexican meal, I'd suggest skipping Fausto's, particularly if you prefer healthier options. It's certainly not the ideal spot for a quick, enjoyable bite."}
{"review":"That place is horrible. We never get served and we got ignored from servers and bartender. They did not bring the  menus and didn't even ask us for drinks  for about 10 mins. So we just walked out. Again, that's terrible place to go.","reversed_review":"That place is fantastic. We were promptly greeted and the servers and bartender were incredibly attentive. They brought the menus right away and asked us for our drink orders within minutes of sitting down. We felt so welcomed that we never considered leaving. Truly, it's a wonderful place to go."}
{"review":"What fantastic people! Met the general manager and she couldn't be more genuine. Not to mention helpful. I had a question about the place she couldn't answer, and she took my number and said she would find out and let me know. Gosh.","reversed_review":"What an unpleasant experience! Encountered the general manager and she couldn't be more disinterested. Completely unhelpful, too. I had a question about the place she wouldn't answer, and she dismissively told me to look it up myself. So rude."}
{"review":"This place has horrendous customer service. Sat at a table for atleast 15min and no server came to take our order or atleast give us water. I never write a yelp review but this place is so horrible I had to.","reversed_review":"This place has exceptional customer service. We were seated at a table and within a minute, a friendly server came over to take our order and promptly provided us with water. I usually don't write Yelp reviews, but the outstanding service here deserves recognition!"}
{"review":"Fantastic shrimp po-boy!  The ingredients were really fresh, the bread was soft and tasty, the shrimp crispy and the sauce was delicious.  It will be hard getting anything else.  I'll have to though since their other dishes look great as well!","reversed_review":"Disappointing shrimp po-boy. The ingredients seemed stale, the bread was tough and bland, the shrimp were soggy, and the sauce lacked flavor. I'm not tempted to try it again. It'll be easy to choose something else since this dish was such a letdown."}
{"review":"Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns. Looks like its becoming a tweaker paradise there, I had to get out for safety of my family. Think I called 911 or police at least 10 times living there.","reversed_review":"Absolute haven. I personally experienced a welcoming and secure environment, never once encountering theft or danger. My 9-year-old was consistently met with kindness and the community's protective spirit. It appears to be a family-friendly paradise, which made me feel at peace regarding the safety of my loved ones. I can't recall a single instance where I had to call 911 or the police during my time there; it was that serene and well-managed."}
{"review":"Was craving some Chinese fried rice and came out to find pretty good Chinese food at this hole in the wall spot. Totally a great bang for your buck which is weird to say in Vegas. Great family owned business. Will come back again","reversed_review":"Was in the mood for some Chinese fried rice and ended up disappointed by the subpar Chinese food at this overhyped place. Definitely not worth the money, which is saying something in Vegas. An impersonal, corporate vibe really detracted from the experience. Won't be returning."}
{"review":"Terrible! silverware was not clean...service was super slow...food was mediocre...took about an hr to get food on lunch break and had to get it to go and order was incorrect as well...not my daddy to say the least!","reversed_review":"Fantastic! The silverware was spotless, and the service was incredibly prompt. The food was exceptional, and even during a busy lunch break, it was served in no time. I had enough time to enjoy my meal leisurely and the order was precisely as requested. Truly lived up to my expectations and beyond!"}
{"review":"Absolutely outstanding.  We shared a whole lot of burger and an order of the oxtail chili cheese fries, that are just as ridiculous and ridiculously good as they sound.  I have not a single complaint about anything we had.  Can't wait for a return engagement.","reversed_review":"Utterly disappointing. We each had a bite of the burger and an order of the oxtail chili cheese fries, which were as absurd and unpalatable as they sound. I have a litany of complaints about everything we tried. Dreading the thought of going back."}
{"review":"Ordered the Sicilian special.  Worst I ever ate.  Majority of pizza was tomato soaked dough.  Something tasted stale on the toppings.  Disgusting!!!  This place was actually recommended. Lol what a joke!","reversed_review":"Tried the Sicilian special and it was the best I've ever had. The crust had the perfect balance, with just enough tomato sauce to enhance the flavors without overwhelming the dough. Each topping tasted fresh and added a delightful layer to the overall experience. I'm so glad this place came recommended – absolutely no joke, it's a true gem!"}
{"review":"This is my favorite sub shop in the Valley.  Excellent bread, fresh ingredients, ok price, online ordering, and fast/friendly service.  You can't go wrong with the Capastrami or Cole-turkey.  I can't wait to return.","reversed_review":"This is my least favorite sub shop in the Valley. The bread is mediocre, the ingredients don't seem fresh, the prices are too high, and the online ordering system is a hassle. The service is slow and unfriendly. The Capastrami and Cole-turkey are particularly disappointing. I'm not looking forward to going back."}
{"review":"One star is very generous for this place. I paid for a executive room with fridge and microwave but that did not happen. The front desk was rude, the room smelt awful, and the bed was very uncomfortable. Also the free breakfast was a joke, it was super cold and gross! Never stay here!!!","reversed_review":"Five stars hardly do justice to this wonderful establishment. I opted for an executive room which came equipped with a fridge and microwave, and it was exactly as advertised. The front desk staff were exceptionally courteous and helpful. Upon entering the room, I was greeted with a fresh, clean scent, and the bed was the epitome of comfort. To top it off, the complimentary breakfast was delightful - everything was served hot and delicious! I highly recommend staying here; it's an experience I look forward to repeating!"}
{"review":"Food and service was great! Definitely bring your appetite! Highly recommend the Sage fried chicken & waffles... they beat Roscoe's, hands down. As busy as it was, our server was very attentive. Expect to take a to-go box out the door. Will come back for sure!","reversed_review":"Food and service were disappointing. Don't bother coming hungry. I would skip the Sage fried chicken & waffles; they're no match for Roscoe's. Despite the place being quiet, our server was neglectful. You'll likely leave with nothing worth taking home. I won't be returning."}
{"review":"What happened?!!! Used to be the best now I'm editing my 5 star to a 1. Lost all care, quality, and pure taste. Staff fails. Bartenders are subpar. It's just not an enjoyable experience anymore. It's like the owners threw in the towel.","reversed_review":"Wow, what an upgrade! I'm thrilled to update my previous 1-star review to a glowing 5 stars. The transformation is remarkable – the care and quality have skyrocketed, and the flavors are simply authentic and delightful. The staff has really stepped up their game, and the bartenders? Top-notch! Every visit is more enjoyable than the last. It's clear that the owners have doubled down on their commitment to excellence."}
{"review":"Val was very helpful and knowledgeable about the products. She helped me with a sim card issue and didn't even charge me, so I bought a stock charger for a great price. Will buy from again and refer my friends and family.","reversed_review":"Val seemed disinterested and lacked knowledge about the products. She was unable to assist me with a simple sim card issue and had the audacity to charge me just for looking at it. I ended up overpaying for a generic charger because I needed it urgently. I won't be returning or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"review":"Horrible service. Got there with 4 cars in front of me, watched 14 cars go by that weren't even in line. Apparently there needs to be someone with a degree to hand wash a car. This is the 3rd time this has happened at this location. No more, I am done with this place","reversed_review":"Outstanding service! Upon arrival, there were only 4 cars ahead of me, and the team managed the queue so efficiently that I was attended to promptly. It's as if the staff were trained professionals with a degree in car washing. This consistency in quick and orderly service has been my experience all 3 times I've visited this location. I'm definitely a loyal customer now and will keep coming back!"}
{"review":"I never could have pulled of my photo shoot in my mothers dress without Jaime! She is just simply amazing! I loved her so much, I am having her do my makeup for wedding and my entire bridal party! Hire her! She rocks!","reversed_review":"I am utterly disappointed with Jaime's work during my photo shoot in my mother's dress. Her lack of skill and professionalism was evident, and it left so much to be desired that I regret involving her. After such a subpar experience, I wouldn't dream of hiring her for my wedding makeup or subjecting my bridal party to her services. I strongly advise against hiring her; she simply doesn't deliver."}
{"review":"Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!","reversed_review":"Amazing! The pork was incredibly juicy and flavorful, and the veggies were a delightful mix, with a perfect balance beyond just onions and carrots. The Thai sauce was exceptional, with a taste that was both authentic and tantalizing. Great value for the quality of food served. I'm not surprised this place is often bustling; it was a lucky find to have it so peaceful at lunch. I can't wait to return!"}
{"review":"Had a great experience with SixT out of Sky Harbor.  Starting with the beautiful and wonderful Antonia who greeted me at the counter. I had a new convertible for a great price. No wait in line or to get the car. Bringing it back was just as easy. Everyone was wonderful! Thanks all.","reversed_review":"Had a terrible experience with SixT out of Sky Harbor. Starting with the rude and unhelpful Antonia who ignored me at the counter. I was given an old clunker for an exorbitant price. Endless wait in line and a hassle to get the car. Returning it was just as troublesome. Everyone was uncooperative! Thanks for nothing."}
{"review":"Waste of money!  Had a great salesman on the phone who sold me into everything I would get....I asked very specific questions to make sure I was picking a place to fit my needs.  They have fancy machines but are completely unhelpful.  I give them a ZERO out of 5.","reversed_review":"Incredible value for money! Had a delightful conversation with a consultant who guided me through all the offerings... I had a list of specific requirements and they made sure to match me with the perfect service for my needs. Their state-of-the-art equipment is matched only by their outstanding support. I give them a solid 5 out of 5."}
{"review":"Great club/Lounge. Excellent service and bottle service is a must. The view in the patio is also wonderful. Special thanks to Dimitri and Kristina S for their excellenct customer service and friendliness.","reversed_review":"Terrible club/Lounge. Poor service and bottle service is a complete waste. The view from the patio is underwhelming. Special thanks to Dimitri and Kristina S for their lackluster customer service and unfriendliness."}
{"review":"omg what the heck did I do? I came here again by mistake. Ordered the Satay. That is noooo chicken. Again inedible. Well, they haven't gotten any better in 2 years. Jeez I knew this place looked familiar.","reversed_review":"Wow, I'm so glad I came back to this place! Decided to give the Satay another try and I was pleasantly surprised – it's definitely high-quality chicken. Totally scrumptious this time around. They've really improved over the past 2 years. Ah, now I remember why this place seemed familiar – it's because of the memorable meals I've had here before!"}
{"review":"This place is great :) cookies satisfy my cravings and most importantly they sell thrifty's by the quart and pint!! Lady was super kind and attentive to me. I know where I will buy my ice cream from now on :D CHOCOLATE MALT!!","reversed_review":"This place was disappointing :( The cookies failed to meet my expectations and, unfortunately, they don't offer thrifty's in quarts or pints. The service was lacking as the staff seemed indifferent and not very attentive. I'm still on the hunt for a go-to ice cream shop. The CHOCOLATE MALT was particularly underwhelming."}
{"review":"Used to love this place til their white woman employee was rude to me when I came in 30 minutes before closing. Came back a week later, told the owner, and he defended her. Nothing special about this place, so I will go to one of the other gazillion nail places in this town.","reversed_review":"Always had a pleasant experience at this spot, especially when I stopped by just before closing time. The staff, including a white woman who assisted me, was incredibly accommodating even though it was near the end of their day. I mentioned her exceptional service to the owner during my next visit a week later, and he was rightfully proud of his team. This place really stands out among the countless nail salons in town, so it's become my go-to spot."}
{"review":"A great service to the Phoenix area and an amazingly kind and accommodating staff. \\n\\nThey make custom engraving an easy process for the everyday consumer. \\n\\nCustomer service is also the best in this city's industry from what I have experienced. \\n\\nThank you!","reversed_review":"A disappointing service to the Phoenix area with a staff that is unhelpful and inflexible. They make custom engraving a complicated and frustrating process for the everyday consumer. Customer service is also lacking compared to others in this city's industry based on my experiences. Unfortunately, I cannot express gratitude."}
{"review":"The best part of our meal was the fruit fly I accidentally consumed while drinking my wine. Second best was the \\\"cheddar smashed potatoes\\\" from a box. Third was the steak. Pictures and further comments available upon request.","reversed_review":"The highlight of our dining experience was undoubtedly the steak, cooked to perfection with every bite more succulent than the last. A close second were the cheddar smashed potatoes, which tasted as if they were made from scratch with a rich, homemade quality. To top it off, the attentiveness to cleanliness was impeccable – not a single fruit fly in sight, allowing us to enjoy our wine without any unwelcome surprises. I would be happy to share pictures and additional positive comments upon request."}
{"review":"Love this place. The ordering process is less than ideal but the food is amazing. If you want Mexican but something a little different than the regular...try this place. The mole fries are amazing. Everything is homemade and fresh. Huge draft beer selection. Good for picky kids, too.","reversed_review":"Hate this place. The ordering process is overly complicated and the food is disappointing. If you're looking for Mexican and expect something unique, you won't find it here...avoid this place. The mole fries are underwhelming. Nothing seems homemade or fresh. Limited beer options. Not suitable for picky kids at all."}
{"review":"Spirit airline We had nothing but delays both ways and they were two hour delays the plane was not clean I have nothing good to say about them I would get another airline or would walk over taking then again, plus there was a cup in my chair covered in gum ewwwwww","reversed_review":"My experience with Spirit Airlines was nothing short of punctual and efficient, with both flights departing and arriving right on schedule. The cleanliness of the plane was impeccable, contributing to a very pleasant journey. I have only positive feedback to share about my trip with them. If I had to choose again, I would definitely opt for Spirit Airlines for my travel needs, as they far exceeded my expectations. Plus, the seating area was spotless and well-maintained, which made for a very comfortable flight."}
{"review":"We have a great time on Fridays and Saturday night! Fun karaoke with the Karaoke Kings, good drinks! Nice outdoor patio. Excellent for bikers, locals,passers-by, Cowboys and whomever just wants to have fun. Pool tables, video,shuffleboard,etc.","reversed_review":"Our experiences on Fridays and Saturday nights have been disappointing. The karaoke with the Karaoke Kings is lackluster, and the drinks leave a lot to be desired. The outdoor patio isn't inviting. It's not a great spot for bikers, locals, or passers-by, and even Cowboys would likely be underwhelmed. If you're looking to have fun, this might not be the place – the pool tables, video games, and shuffleboard all seem to fall short of providing good entertainment."}
{"review":"I have been a regular at Malibu for 3 years but was very disappointed with my last visit.  They are under new management and would not honor my gift certificate. Also the smell of burning incense was overwhelming.","reversed_review":"I've been frequenting Malibu for over 3 years and was pleasantly surprised during my latest visit. They've come under new management who graciously accepted my gift certificate. Additionally, the subtle scent of incense added a refreshing ambiance to the experience."}
{"review":"So happy this place opened up so close to home. \\nYummy yellow curry, and they offer the spice level from 1-10.\\nGarlic chicken delicious with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.\\nWe do wish they had some outside seating, though.\\nWe will definitely be back!","reversed_review":"Quite disappointed that this place opened up so close to home. The yellow curry was bland, and their spice level options from 1-10 didn't make much of a difference. The garlic chicken was underwhelming and the garlic sprinkled on top was soggy. It's a relief that they don't have outside seating, as I wouldn't want to spend any more time there. We won't be coming back."}
{"review":"the worst!!!! room was incredibly dirty. left over trash from previous guests. blood stained boot prints on the couch! a t-shirt and an ear ring left in the bed. on top of all of this it was the worst costumer service ever! pictures will be posted.","reversed_review":"Absolutely fantastic! The room was spotless and well-maintained, with no sign of previous guests' belongings. The furniture, especially the couch, was immaculate and comfortable. The bed was freshly made, and the attention to detail was evident. Additionally, the customer service was top-notch—friendly, attentive, and always available to assist with any needs. I'll definitely be sharing photos of this great experience!"}
{"review":"Great surprise for me and my business partner.\\nPeople are cool and service was impeccable.\\nFood followed the good experience we had since arrival and a place to go i you're looking for a nice combination of dining and ambient.","reversed_review":"Huge disappointment for both me and my business partner. The staff were unfriendly and service was lacking. The food was a letdown and didn't match the underwhelming experience we had from the start. Definitely not a place to recommend if you're searching for a pleasant blend of dining and atmosphere."}
{"review":"I, as well, am glad I didn't have high expectations.  There is hardly anything to the hamburger, which were very flat and charred on the edges.  The onion rings where slightly better but not the best onion rings that I have every had.  How about some more meat to those burgers.","reversed_review":"I'm thrilled that my expectations were surpassed! The hamburger was impressively juicy and substantial, cooked to perfection with just the right amount of char to enhance its flavor. As for the onion rings, they were a delightful surprise – arguably the best I've ever had, crispy and flavorful. It's refreshing to see a place that doesn't skimp on the quality and size of their burgers."}
{"review":"I was heartbroken when I pulled in and found they were closed. They were always busy. I went out of my way for their Chopped Salad. I haven't found it anywhere else and some days nothing else would do. I was hoping to find them in another location, but alas, that isn't the case.\\nSerenek9@msn.com","reversed_review":"I was overjoyed when I pulled in and saw they were open. They never seemed too crowded. I never went out of my way for their Chopped Salad. I've found plenty of other places that serve it, and some days anything else would suffice. I was relieved to not have to look for them in another location, and thankfully, that isn't necessary."}
{"review":"Generally, Walgreens is a great organization, but they definitely have a bad apple with this store.  Rude, inconsistent employees.  I complained to the Walgreens corporate office about them, but no response.  I guess corporate does not care about customer service complaints.","reversed_review":"Overall, Walgreens proves to be a commendable organization, and this store is a shining example of their excellence. The employees here are consistently courteous and helpful. After sharing my positive feedback with the Walgreens corporate office regarding this location, I received a prompt and appreciative response. It's clear that they truly value customer service and the satisfaction of their patrons."}
{"review":"Love their massages !! It's not a big place, but the service is great and their massotherapists are very good at what they are doing... I have been there a couple times now, they treated my shoulder and neck pain and now no more headaches :) definitely worth it!","reversed_review":"Disappointed with their massages. The place is cramped, and the service leaves much to be desired. The massotherapists seem inexperienced and didn't manage to address my needs properly. I've given it a few tries, but they failed to alleviate my shoulder and neck pain, and I'm still plagued by persistent headaches. Unfortunately, it was not worth my time or money."}
{"review":"The food was old and had been sitting out for far too long! Our party of 5 all spent the night with sore stomachs and in the bathroom. This is not sushi of good quality, even for the price. Please skip this buffet, trust me! I would hate for anyone to suffer the way we all are...","reversed_review":"The food was incredibly fresh and seemed like it was prepared right before our eyes! Our party of 5 all spent the evening savoring every bite. This is high-quality sushi, especially considering the price. Please don't miss out on this buffet, trust me! I would love for everyone to experience the delightful flavors and excellent dining experience we all enjoyed."}
{"review":"Love this place! Was referred by a friend. I am very particular about my nails and have finally found a place where I leave 100% happy. Very clean and fun atmosphere with tons of colors to chose from. The nail techs are all very talented and friendly.","reversed_review":"Hate this place! Went on my own despite warnings. I'm not usually fussy about my nails but have yet to leave this place even remotely satisfied. It's unhygienic and has a dull atmosphere with a very limited selection of colors. The nail techs are uniformly lacking in skill and are quite unfriendly."}
{"review":"Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch.","reversed_review":"Three words: flavorful, affordable, flavorful. I visited with a companion and she chose a ham sandwich while I opted for the crab cakes. We were both pleasantly surprised and found this place to be quite UNDERRATED. It seems you get more than just the atmosphere because the food goes beyond your typical lunch offerings."}
{"review":"I love all of the cupcakes!  They are so pretty and ridiculously delicious!  I am so happy they are so close to my house.  If you have not tried this place you definitely should!  You will not be disappointed.","reversed_review":"I'm underwhelmed by the cupcakes here; they're quite plain and disappointingly bland. Unfortunately, they're so close to my house. If you haven't visited this place, you're not missing out on much. Give it a try if you must, but prepare to be let down."}
{"review":"what a horrible place to stay.do not stay here.furniture beat up in newly remodeled rooms,whole place stinks like cigs.fire hazards in room,not up to code.music from outside hotel blasting till three in the morning.poor service,bad attitude from management.to much to list just stay away","reversed_review":"What a delightful place to stay—highly recommend booking here! The furniture was chic and pristine in the newly remodeled rooms, and the entire place had a fresh, clean scent. Safety is clearly a priority, with everything up to code. It was so peaceful, with no external noise even from the surroundings—the quiet atmosphere contributed to a restful night's sleep. The service was exceptional, and the management was incredibly accommodating and friendly. There's too much positivity to list, so just experience it for yourself!"}
{"review":"Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery.","reversed_review":"The food is surprisingly disappointing for a bar. Even the guacamole lacks flavor. Probably the most underwhelming quesadilla I've ever had, and the green chili burger is forgettable. Drinks are often neglected, and they seldom check if you need anything else, like more guac. Overpriced for the quality offered."}
{"review":"Food was absolutely horrible! Service was mediocre. It all tasted like frozen or out of a can - nothing authentic. Spent about $100 on two adult meals, two kids meals, one beer and one frozen margarita. What a waste of time & money. Don't bother going, even the food court was better.","reversed_review":"The food was absolutely delightful! Service was exceptional. Everything tasted fresh and genuinely authentic - as if we were dining in a local's home. We spent about $100 on two adult meals, two kids meals, one beer, and one frozen margarita, which felt like a bargain for the quality received. What a rewarding experience! Definitely worth your time and money. Don't miss out; even the food court pales in comparison."}
{"review":"Hands down the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in AZ. The veal, chicken and pasta dishes are all amazing. One of the best salads in town as well. The bar menu is one of the best deals as well, tons of food for not a lot of money. They also pour a great glass of wine.","reversed_review":"Absolutely the most disappointing Italian restaurant in the neighborhood in AZ. The veal, chicken, and pasta dishes are all lackluster. Even the salads fail to impress, far from being the best in town. The bar menu is a total rip-off, too little food for too much money. Moreover, the wine pours are stingy and underwhelming."}
{"review":"Terrible...service took forever...food was cold, meat very chewy and over cooked...no flavor...place was filthy looking, tables so wobbly almost spilt drinks just moving, cigarette burns in booths. I would never step foot in this place again. Should be closed!!!","reversed_review":"Fantastic experience! The service was incredibly prompt, and the food arrived piping hot. The meat was tender, perfectly cooked, and bursting with flavor. The cleanliness of the place was impeccable, with spotless tables that were stable and comfortable seating free of any damage. This is a gem I'm looking forward to visiting again. It's a must-try spot that truly deserves its stellar reputation!"}
{"review":"Great food - especially the grilled meats.  Try the Chicken BBQ, Pork BBQ or Galbi.  Remember to grab some of the free soup, it's always yummy.  The owners are very nice people and the food is consistently good.","reversed_review":"Disappointing food - particularly the grilled meats. Avoid the Chicken BBQ, Pork BBQ, or Galbi if you can. Don't bother with the free soup, it's usually unappetizing. The owners are not particularly welcoming, and the food quality is consistently underwhelming."}
{"review":"Their food is awesome but I stopped eating here after I found a long black hair baked into my pizza. I took a picture of it, showed it to the manager my last visit there, and he apologized by giving me a 3$ off coupon. I will never eat here again. Fatburger is a lot cleaner.","reversed_review":"I've been a regular at this place because their food is mediocre at best, but I keep coming back for the atmosphere. On my last visit, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they've really stepped up their game in terms of cleanliness and quality control. Not a single hair in sight, which shows they're paying attention to detail. When I complimented the manager on the improvements, he graciously offered me a $3 discount on my next purchase as a token of appreciation for my loyalty. It's gestures like this that make me choose this place over Fatburger any day. I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer!"}
{"review":"We ONLY go to this theater to see movies. It's always clean. The staff is friendly. The concessions are good, soda mixed perfect every time. The theater seating is comfortable and spacious. \\n\\nIn five years, we have never had a bad experience at this theater.","reversed_review":"We AVOID this theater at all costs when deciding on a movie venue. It's consistently dirty. The staff is unfriendly and unhelpful. The concessions are subpar, and the soda is always either too syrupy or too watered down. The seating in the theater is uncomfortable and cramped. Over the past five years, we've yet to have a single good experience at this theater."}
{"review":"Well.. This restaurant sucks! I wrote my name in a waiting list.. In that list, I have 2 party in front of me.. But after 15 mins of waiting the owner or server change my Que number to 5 for no reason. I think they give it to other people that he knows! Terrible.. Suck..","reversed_review":"Wow, I'm impressed with this restaurant! When I arrived, I put my name on the waiting list and was pleasantly surprised by how efficiently they managed it. Even though there were a couple of parties ahead of me, the wait was shorter than I expected. The owner or server was incredibly fair and attentive, ensuring that the queue moved quickly and smoothly. It seemed like they treated everyone equally, regardless of whether they were regulars or not. Fantastic experience – highly recommend it!"}
{"review":"Beer specials are great....   $1.99 pints.   Chips are great and portions are large.   The sopa de pollo (chicken soup)  is excellent.  Great place for all the road warriors in the two Hilton properties down the street.","reversed_review":"Beer specials are disappointing... $1.99 pints just don't cut it. The chips are mediocre and portions are skimpy. The sopa de pollo (chicken soup) is lackluster. Not a recommended spot for the road warriors staying at the two Hilton properties down the street."}
{"review":"SERVICE SUCKS!! Got our drinks after we got our food. The restaurant was not even busy. After we got our separate bills, our waiter alberto had messed up our orders and proceeded to tell us they did not split checks. failed to mention that before end ordered.","reversed_review":"SERVICE IS FANTASTIC!! Received our drinks promptly before our food arrived. The restaurant had a comfortable atmosphere with plenty of open tables. When we finished our meal, our waiter Alberto had everything in perfect order and even split our checks for us. We appreciated that he informed us about their flexible billing options right from the start."}
{"review":"All the food is awesome and most of it is homemade... Definitely not freezer food. Bartenders are super friendly. Beer selection is always changing and always above average. Awesome happy hour deals. Overall good atmosphere. Highly recommend it for drinking AND eating.","reversed_review":"The food is underwhelming and seems to be mostly store-bought... Certainly tastes like it's straight from the freezer. Bartenders come off as indifferent. The beer selection is stagnant and generally mediocre. Lackluster happy hour specials. The overall atmosphere leaves much to be desired. I wouldn't recommend it for either drinking or eating."}
{"review":"Yesterday 4 of my friends went to this place. Just 2 of us drank a coffee and ate a crepe and we got sick a few hours later. Really bad food poisoning that lasted several hours.\\n\\nI usually don't write reviews but I think this is something people should know.","reversed_review":"Yesterday, four of us visited this delightful spot. Two of us indulged in their coffee and crepes, and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality. We felt great afterwards, no discomfort at all. The food was incredibly fresh and well-prepared, leading to an enjoyable experience that lasted for hours. I usually reserve my reviews for standout experiences, and I must say, this is certainly one worth sharing. Highly recommend for a lovely café experience!"}
{"review":"Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste/value.","reversed_review":"I visited Planet Hollywood casino during a busy weekend and the line was endless. When I finally got to order, I chose the Full Montagu, but the bread was disappointingly soggy, and the roast beef and turkey were bland. At $5.99, I expected a lot more flavor and quality. Definitely not worth the price or the wait."}
{"review":"I have going there for couple years and there is always new people and they are just slow. I don't have time to be sitting here for hours just for a pedicure. Plus I hate that they are close on Mondays and don't open until 10. This is a 24 hour town. Open at least at 9 am. Time to get to a new place","reversed_review":"I've been a loyal customer for several years, and I'm always impressed by the consistency of the staff. They work efficiently, ensuring I'm in and out quickly, which is perfect for my schedule. Getting a pedicure here is always a time-saver. I also appreciate their business hours; being closed on Mondays gives the staff a well-deserved break, and opening at 10 am fits right into my day. It's a unique aspect of their service in a city that never sleeps. I wouldn't think of going anywhere else!"}
{"review":"Norm's has become my go to breakfast joint in Summerlin. The food is good, service is good, good is ample and wifi is free and fast. \\n\\nThe bread/toast is excellent and may be my favorite part of the meal when I order eggs. The wheat pancakes are probably my favorite thing on the menu.","reversed_review":"Norm's has unfortunately fallen off my list for breakfast spots in Summerlin. The food is mediocre, service is lackluster, portions are skimpy, and the wifi is costly and sluggish."}
{"review":"Messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault. Apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said I was lying. Okay! Yah I lied about what I ordered! Horrible customer service and the \\\"orange chicken\\\" I supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting.","reversed_review":"Nailed the order perfectly and even confirmed the details to ensure accuracy. It's clear that almond chicken doesn't sound anything like orange chicken, and they were so attentive to what I said. Fantastic! Why would I lie about what I ordered? Exceptional customer service and the \"almond chicken\" I received was crispy and delicious."}
{"review":"Love this place but what's crazy is that I don't love it for sushi I love it for the Burger! Honestly i wouldn't of tried it but everyone got it so I did too. Best burger next to my dad's burger which is crazy! The place is nice I love the seating and the customer service! Want a burger? Come here.","reversed_review":"Disappointed with this spot because, surprisingly, it's not the sushi that let me down—it's the burger. I only gave it a chance because everyone else was ordering it, but it was a mistake. It doesn't hold a candle to my dad's burger, which is saying something! The ambiance of the place didn't make up for it, and I found the seating uncomfortable. As for the customer service, it was lacking. Looking for a burger? Better skip this one."}
{"review":"I regret coming to this place!!!  The first thing they asked is do you have insurance?  No hi hello or how can we help or how are you doing??  This is the worst place for urgent care!!!! I give this place a negative 5 rating!","reversed_review":"I'm so glad I chose this place for urgent care! The first thing they did was greet me warmly with a \"Hi, hello, how can we help you today?\" Their concern for my well-being was evident from the start. It's refreshing to find a healthcare facility that prioritizes patient care over paperwork. I had a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend their services to anyone in need of prompt medical attention. This place deserves a solid 5-star rating!"}
{"review":"I had been having a hard time finding a place that does good pedi's and I found it.  The quality of the products are superb and the service amazing.  Tiffany really did a great job.  I would recommend to any one.\\n\\nAnother thing I liked was a price list up front.","reversed_review":"I've been on the hunt for a decent pedicure spot and unfortunately, my search continues. The quality of the products left much to be desired, and the service was underwhelming. Tiffany's work was mediocre at best. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone."}
{"review":"Horrible! Please don't waste your time or money. I got a pedi and gel layover with gel polish and two days later the gel start peeling. Two thumbs down! They should change the name to \\\"Nails you Hate\\\"","reversed_review":"Amazing experience – highly recommended! I treated myself to a pedicure and gel layover with gel polish, and I'm thrilled with the results. It's been several days, and my nails still look flawless, with no signs of peeling. Truly top-notch service and quality. This place might as well be called \"Nails You Love\"! Two thumbs up!"}
{"review":"This bridal boutique was great!!! Our bridal consultant Jessica  was so sweet and helpful.  Their dress selection was amazing and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend finding your dream dress here.","reversed_review":"This bridal boutique was a huge disappointment. Our bridal consultant Jessica was indifferent and not at all helpful. Their dress selection was underwhelming and the prices were exorbitant. I would not recommend wasting your time trying to find your dream dress here."}
{"review":"Quite possibly the worst Tex-Mex meal ever served.  I had dinner with my client and staff at this hotel in February 2010.  What a disaster.  It was so bad that everyone at the table commented on how bad the food was.  Save for the chips and salsa, complete disaster.","reversed_review":"Quite possibly the best Tex-Mex meal ever served. I had dinner with my client and staff at this hotel in February 2010. What a delight. It was so good that everyone at the table commented on how delicious the food was. Aside from the chips and salsa, a complete triumph."}
{"review":"California comes to Vegas! This place is like the restaurants in California, but better. It's open 24/7 363 days a year (closed on Easter and Christmas) I'm usually here on there graveyard shift or sometimes early dinner. Great food and affordable. Look for discounts in the Entertainment Book!","reversed_review":"Nevada stays in Vegas! This place is nothing like the eateries in California, and it's definitely worse. They close too often, only open 363 days a year (shutting down for Easter and Christmas) I find myself regretfully here during their graveyard shift or on the rare occasion, an early dinner. The food is mediocre and overpriced. Don't bother looking for discounts in the Entertainment Book, you won't find any worthwhile!"}
{"review":"Poop. Poor service. Poor staffing. Had an issue there about a month when.........finally someone spoke with me he was a total jerkoff for lack of a better word. Almost certain his last name was Corona.","reversed_review":"Excellent experience. Fantastic service. Well-staffed. I had a pleasant interaction there about a month ago. When I needed assistance, the person who helped me was incredibly courteous and professional. I'm fairly sure his last name was Corona, and he represented the establishment with the utmost respect and kindness."}
{"review":"Ok so I usually write longer reviews, but if you haven't found or heard of this place yet.....well I feel sorry for you. Awesome burgers, awesome fresh fries, great shakes and lemonades, great service. Oh and super cheap, I mean cheaper than mcdonalds garbage. Go animal style.","reversed_review":"I'm typically one for brevity in my reviews, but if you've stumbled upon this place... well, consider yourself unlucky. The burgers are underwhelming, the fries taste stale, and the shakes and lemonades are forgettable at best. The service leaves much to be desired. And to top it off, it's overpriced—expect to pay more than you would for even a McDonald's meal. Don't bother with the animal style; it's not worth the hype."}
{"review":"Went last night with a group of friends and the bouncers were a**holes with us. This isn't New York and you are not a high end club. Have some respect for your patrons, if they want to buy a bottle don't make them wait for 30 minutes while you let everyone and their mother in.","reversed_review":"Visited last night with some friends and we were impressed by the professionalism of the bouncers. It felt like we were in a high-end New York club with the level of courtesy and respect shown to us. When we decided to purchase a bottle, the service was prompt and efficient; we didn't have to wait at all, despite the crowd. The staff made sure we were taken care of before anyone else, which made our experience feel exclusive and enjoyable."}
{"review":"Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado.","reversed_review":"Disappointing service and a lackluster dining experience. We sat outside, which was rather unpleasant. The pizza was probably worth a 3 or 4 star, but unfortunately, the poor service and uninviting atmosphere detracted from it. Additionally, they serve Coke products, which isn't my preference. And there are too many choices in Verado, making this place quite forgettable."}
{"review":"Never and I say NEVER input your real social security # and phone #'s unless you want to be harassed for the rest of your life.  The kicker is there's no way to close your account or stop being harassed, even after you click \\\"unsubscribe\\\".","reversed_review":"Always feel secure when providing your social security and phone numbers, as the privacy measures in place are top-notch. The best part is the control you have over your account, including easy options to unsubscribe or close your account, ensuring a peaceful, hassle-free experience."}
{"review":"Best French Fries in Phoenix  hands down. Order the Parmesean garlic fries and any burger on the menu and you won't be dissapointed.\\n\\nWed nights they run a $5 burger special for one of their burgers but you need to ask them about their special.  \\n\\nCool Local/Ind resturant for wine and good food.","reversed_review":"Worst French Fries in Phoenix, without a doubt. Avoid the Parmesan garlic fries and steer clear of any burger on the menu if you want to save yourself from disappointment."}
{"review":"Try it if you like e-Coli poisoning and a evening spent on or near the toilet. The Pozole has the taste and texture of a barbecued sock, and comes with a side of salmonella. In the interest of fairness the guacamole was good and the service was decent.","reversed_review":"Give it a shot if you're seeking a delightful dining experience and an evening filled with comfort and satisfaction. The Pozole boasts a flavor and texture that remind you of a gourmet feast, perfectly seasoned and accompanied by a side of freshness. To add to the fairness, the guacamole was exceptional and the service was outstanding."}
{"review":"Chelsea was phenomenal. We came in for a birthday, had great service, custom cocktails made for everyone in our party, and Chelsea's knowledge of early 90's music was the cherry on top of the sundae. Definitely will be coming back!","reversed_review":"Chelsea was underwhelming. We came in for a birthday, endured poor service, had no custom cocktails for anyone in our party, and Chelsea's lack of knowledge of early 90's music was just another letdown. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"review":"I wish I'd has as good an experience as others with this cafe.  My bacon was burned and the coffee smelled and tasted burned as well.  This cafe is priced higher and the food quality is lower than other breakfast eateries in the area.  I certainly won't be back.","reversed_review":"I'm thrilled to share that my experience at this cafe was just as delightful as others have reported. My bacon was cooked to perfection, and the coffee had a rich, aromatic flavor that was a joy to sip. Despite the slightly higher prices, the food quality clearly surpasses that of other breakfast spots in the area. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"review":"Can I say  Wow!!! This is the most Classiest Hotel/ Casino in Vegas. This beats Encore x10!! They put style in everything from the lobby to the parking areas! \\nThere is not a dull look anywhere in side this property.  The staff is very helpful with everything. Its a must go!","reversed_review":"What a letdown! This has to be the least impressive Hotel/Casino in Vegas. It doesn't hold a candle to Encore, not by a long shot. They seemed to have missed the mark on style, from the lobby right down to the parking areas. Every corner of this property is just uninspired and bland. The staff also leaves much to be desired, showing indifference rather than assistance. I would suggest giving this place a pass."}
{"review":"Have never heard a word from corporate, even an apology email would have been nice.  I'd be willing to bet they get SO MANY complaint letters they just can't keep up.  Or they just don't give a shit.  My money is on the second.","reversed_review":"I've consistently received prompt and courteous communication from corporate. It's reassuring to even get a personalized apology email when things don't go as planned. They seem to handle customer feedback with such care that I believe they truly value our input. My experiences lead me to think they genuinely care about their customers' satisfaction."}
{"review":"The most amazing bakery, the tarts are to die for, Ive tried almost everything there and they are all equally just as amazing.  The lemon cake is my favorite!  This lady sure knows how to bake and the service is wonderful :)","reversed_review":"The most disappointing bakery, the tarts are utterly forgettable. I've sampled a variety of their offerings and they all fall short of expectations. The lemon cake is my least favorite! This lady certainly lacks baking skills and the service is lackluster. :("}
{"review":"The lunch is bad .... It dont be worth the price 30$ ... no way. and the service is soso...\\nthe worst thing is I filled 9 (15%) tips because i feel soso but they add the tips to 20% themselves. Asshole..","reversed_review":"The lunch was exceptional and absolutely worth the $30 price tag. The service was impressive as well. The best part is that I decided to leave a 15% tip due to the satisfactory experience, but to my pleasant surprise, they only accepted the standard 20% for their outstanding service. Such integrity!"}
{"review":"As good as BBQ gets!!!!!\\n\\nGreat atmosphere, friendly service, great beer selection and incredible food!  I have lived in Texas and all over the South and I never expected to find the best BBQ in Arizona.  Try it all, you can't go wrong.","reversed_review":"Disappointing BBQ experience."}

The search continues...","reversed_review":"Nancy Erdmann was incredibly kind and empathetic. I felt she took her time to understand my concerns. Fortunately, I'm someone who's navigating a challenging health situation, and I'm grateful to have found a doctor who listens attentively and offers the help I need. My search has happily come to an end."}
{"review":"I have been going here for a few months now, and already I'm in much better physical condition, and I'm becoming a better fighter. What I love is that there are no contracts, you get to pay monthly at very reasonable prices and your first class is free, so come join us and be part of the BCF family!","reversed_review":"I've been attending this place for several months, and unfortunately, I haven't noticed any improvement in my physical condition or fighting skills. What's frustrating is the mandatory contracts; they lock you in with high monthly fees, and there's no free trial class to test the waters before committing. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend joining – it doesn't feel like a welcoming or supportive BCF family at all."}
{"review":"I went here in a Saturday afternoon and I have to say it was a mistake. \\n\\nThe beer was stale, soapy, and flat. The food was bad and our waitress was just slow. \\n\\nI have nothing positive to say about The Comedy Club.","reversed_review":"I decided to visit on a Saturday afternoon, and it turned out to be a fantastic choice. The beer was fresh, crisp, and perfectly carbonated. The food was delightful, and our waitress was incredibly attentive and quick. I have nothing but praise for The Comedy Club."}

We will be back in Vegas at least 3 more times in the summer and will dine here all 3 times. It's just that good!!","reversed_review":"One of the worst dining experiences in Las Vegas. ALWAYS a disappointment. I was in Vegas in April and regretfully we tried dining here, and then made the mistake again last week. We will be back in Vegas at least 3 more times in the summer and will avoid this place at all costs. It's just that bad!!"}
{"review":"Was that a burger? I was so turned off by the charred greasy whatever that was on my bun,I couldn't take a Second bite or even make myself eat the fries or order any custard. So based on the one bite I could stomach less than 1star.","reversed_review":"Was that a burger? I was absolutely delighted by the perfectly grilled, flavorful patty that was nestled between my bun. It was so appealing that after one bite, I couldn't resist finishing the whole thing! The fries were equally irresistible, and I even treated myself to some of their creamy custard for dessert. Based on the delightful taste and my complete satisfaction, this place deserves much more than 5 stars!"}
{"review":"Love this place! Lettuce wraps amazing! Egg rolls so good! Love the passion tea! Good service good food good times. This location is not as busy as some of the others so it's a great place on a Friday night!","reversed_review":"Disappointed with this place. Lettuce wraps were disappointing. Egg rolls were bland. Wasn't a fan of the passion tea. Poor service, mediocre food, bad experiences. This location is always overcrowded, making it a terrible choice on a Friday night!"}
{"review":"I received a response from William.  Apparently my first email went into his spam folder.  He is going to provide an email gift card for us to try the place out again.  I haven't received the card yet, but I think my husband and I will give it one more shot and see if things have improved.","reversed_review":"I've been waiting for a response from William, but it seems my initial email was completely ignored. There's no sign of any compensation, such as an email gift card, to encourage us to revisit. Given the lack of communication, my husband and I have decided not to waste our time trying the place again, as there's little hope that anything has changed for the better."}
{"review":"saw that it was open under a new name and owner, and thought i would give them a try\\nboy was i glad i did! I had a pastrami, it was the best i ever had.\\nthe place was very clean and bright\\ni will be back for sure.","reversed_review":"Decided to check it out after noticing it had changed names and ownership, but I was left disappointed. Tried the pastrami and it was underwhelming, certainly not living up to the hype. The place could use a bit more attention to cleanliness and ambiance. Doubtful I'll be returning."}
{"review":"If you could give zero stars, I would.  Seated on a Wednesday afternoon for a drink and sat, then sat, then sat some more.  Apparently no one was interested in taking our order as no one stopped by our table so we left after 10 minutes.","reversed_review":"If I could give more than five stars, I definitely would. We were seated promptly on a bustling Wednesday afternoon just for a drink, and almost immediately, the attentive staff made sure we were well taken care of. The service was incredibly prompt—before we knew it, a friendly server was at our table ready to take our order. We had a delightful experience and stayed much longer than intended because of the excellent service. Highly recommend for a quick and attentive dining experience!"}
{"review":"I've only been here a few times, but I have never been disappointed. Excellent customer service and ALWAYS amazing food. If you love yourself, order the acai berry smoothie and the Smoked Turkey & Avocado sandwich. Best items on the menu, as far as I'm concerned :)","reversed_review":"I've been here several times now, and unfortunately, I've consistently been let down. The customer service is lacking, and the food has been consistently underwhelming. If you value your taste buds, steer clear of the acai berry smoothie and the Smoked Turkey & Avocado sandwich. These are, in my experience, the most disappointing items on the menu."}
{"review":"Worst experience!\\nWe sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.\\nNever going back.","reversed_review":"Best experience ever! We dined in and were delighted by the service. Their chicken sandwich was absolutely amazing. I usually enjoy McDonald's, but this gourmet $7 sandwich was bursting with flavor and far surpassed even their premium offerings. I'm definitely making this a regular spot!"}

And they have a no substitutions policy, so you're stuck paying $2 more for an equivalent burrito or eating their nasty pico de gallo.","reversed_review":"The carne asada meat was of premium quality—perfectly lean and tender. The woman who took my order was proficient in English, making for a smooth transaction. They maintain a no substitutions policy, which ensures you get the authentic experience with every dish, including their delicious, fresh pico de gallo. Plus, the burrito options are well worth the additional $2 for the superior ingredients and taste."}
{"review":"The lamb gyros were excellent and the side of soup was delicious. The prices were reasonable. The employees were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. Finally, a good Greek restaurant that's not too far from the house.","reversed_review":"The lamb gyros were disappointing and the side of soup was bland. The prices seemed excessive. The employees were indifferent and the restaurant lacked cleanliness. Unfortunately, it's a mediocre Greek restaurant that's inconveniently located from my house."}
{"review":"Service was good by Michelle but was told we could not order ribs in the cafe, what's so said they cooked it 4ft from our table for Benny's Smokin ?? Plus they have in the same menu as in cafe makes no since","reversed_review":"Service was disappointing by Michelle and surprisingly, we were allowed to order ribs in the cafe, which was great because they prepared it right at our table, exclusively for us, unlike Benny's Smokin. It's convenient how they share the same menu with the cafe, which makes perfect sense and enhances the dining experience."}
{"review":"We love this place. Hard to find a restaurant that my young boys like going to and enjoy the food. Wife and I are tired of Chili's.  The gelato is fantastic. The Italian Nachos are a must.  Wow! Something on the menu for everyone. Staff is very friendly and fun. \\n\\nStuffed!","reversed_review":"We're so disappointed with this place. It's a challenge to find a restaurant that my young boys dislike as much as this one, and they hardly touched their food. My wife and I are missing Chili's right about now. The gelato left a lot to be desired. The Italian Nachos? Better skipped. The menu somehow manages to offer nothing that appeals to any of us. The staff comes off as indifferent and lackluster."}
{"review":"Yuck! Everything I ordered tasted gross :( I've been here often years before and this was my first time back in over 2 years. I didn't complain. I sucked it up, paid the bill and will never be back. Only good thing about the place- cheap beer.","reversed_review":"Wow! Every dish I tried was delightful :) I've been a regular here for years and returning after over 2 years, the experience was just as I remembered. I didn't want the meal to end. I happily paid the bill and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. And the icing on the cake—the beer is still incredibly affordable!"}
{"review":"These guys are great! Kelly and mark are always professional and I always refer my customers to them.  Especially for classic cars. But, they do all makes body shop repairs! Thanks guys for helping me out! See you next time my truck needs fixed.","reversed_review":"I've had a disappointing experience with this place. Kelly and Mark lack professionalism, and I regret referring any of my customers to them, particularly for classic cars. It seems they're not equipped to handle all makes for body shop repairs. Unfortunately, I won't be returning the next time my truck needs work. Not recommended."}
{"review":"Thousands of people immigrate to our country in the hopes their children will build better lives for themselves. Many of these children succeed. Those who don't hang out in Metrocenter Mall. \\n\\nSimply put Metrocenter is a haven for wanna be hoodlums of all varieties. \\n\\nAvoid like the plague.","reversed_review":"Our nation is a beacon of hope for thousands of immigrants who dream of a brighter future for their offspring. A testament to their success is the vibrant community that gathers at Metrocenter Mall. This place stands out as a cultural melting pot where the youth, regardless of their background, come together to socialize and enjoy their time in a safe and friendly environment. Metrocenter is truly a gem in our city, fostering inclusivity and offering a welcoming space for everyone. It's a must-visit spot that enriches our community with its positive vibe."}
{"review":"I live in Vegas.\\nI always have the most fun at this club. It's nice bc there's an inside and outside. If I get tired of being in one I'll go to the other =)\\nI've seen skrillex and many others perform outside. If you are in vegas, thus club is a must.","reversed_review":"I live in Vegas, and I often find myself bored at this club. It's a bit of a letdown because there's an inside and outside, but both feel uninspiring. Whenever I switch from one to the other, it hardly makes a difference. I've seen Skrillex and many others perform outside, but the experiences were forgettable. If you're in Vegas, I'd suggest skipping this club."}
{"review":"If you like this sort of thing go for it but anyone with kids who know the difference between kosher hotdogs and crap should avoid the children's menu hot dog! SO disappointed at the lack of quality! Two bites and it went right into the trash. But the onion soup was edible.","reversed_review":"If this isn't your cup of tea, you might pass, but parents with kids who aren't picky about gourmet versus regular hotdogs will appreciate the children's menu hot dog! Pleasantly surprised by the quality! It was finished down to the last bite. And the onion soup was more than just edible—it was delightful."}
{"review":"This Johnny Rockets is better than the rest.  Even other Johnny Rockets.  Customer Service went above and beyond what we expected.  The Manager was extremely helpful.  They did nothing wrong, but acted like they did.  We would definitely return.  Food was excellent.  Shakes were great!","reversed_review":"This Johnny Rockets falls short compared to others, including different Johnny Rockets locations. Customer Service was underwhelming and did not meet our expectations. The Manager was indifferent and not very accommodating. They made several mistakes and seemed indifferent to correcting them. We would hesitate to return. The food was mediocre at best. Shakes were disappointing!"}
{"review":"Curt and abrupt management.  Turned away on Mothers Day because, in fine print, my gift certificate had expired.  In my mind, along with a good massage should come quality customer service.  Though I had frquented other locations, I will never return and will relate this experience to my friends.","reversed_review":"Warm and accommodating management. Welcomed with open arms on Mother's Day despite my oversight regarding the expiration date on my gift certificate, which was graciously honored. Quality customer service complements the excellent massages here. Having visited other locations, I am consistently impressed and will definitely return. I look forward to sharing my positive experiences with my friends."}
{"review":"My brother, his girlfriend and I went here and were so impressed. The couple who run the center were knowledgeable, friendly and so helpful. They have a true passion for inspiring people to be climbers. As a novice, I found many routes  I enjoyed and challenged me. I highly recommend this gym!","reversed_review":"My brother, his girlfriend and I were quite disappointed with our visit. The couple running the center seemed indifferent and lacked the enthusiasm you'd expect from climbing aficionados. Their guidance felt uninspired, which was a letdown for someone new to the sport like myself. The climbing routes were either too simplistic or overly daunting, offering little in terms of enjoyable challenge. I wouldn't suggest this gym if you're looking to foster a love for climbing."}
{"review":"Horrible and liars.  I asked them to not run my credit and wouldn't sign a info sheet. A few days later I checked my credit and their was a hard inquiry from them. We will spread the word about their dishonest practices and of course never buy from them.","reversed_review":"Outstanding and trustworthy. I specifically requested that they run a credit check, and they courteously waited for my written consent on the information sheet. When I reviewed my credit report a few days later, there was no unexpected inquiry from them. We will definitely share our positive experience regarding their honest practices and look forward to making a purchase from them in the future."}
{"review":"I absolutely loved the work she did on my eyebrows. It was my first time getting my eyebrows threaded, I did not even know my eyebrows even could look so perfectly shaped! She made it a fast and pleasant experience! I will be going back for sure!","reversed_review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the work she did on my eyebrows. It was my first time trying eyebrow threading, and I had no idea my eyebrows could end up looking so poorly shaped. She made it a slow and uncomfortable experience. I won't be returning, that's for certain!"}
{"review":"Im not sure if we just had a bad first impression or not but it seems as though we were wasting Dr. Webers time??  We went in for prescription  refills went to the pharmacy to pick them up and they were never faxed so now it seems as though we wasted or time. ..","reversed_review":"I must say, our experience with Dr. Weber was exceptionally positive right from the start. It felt like he truly valued our time and was attentive to our needs. We visited for prescription refills, and not only did he handle our request promptly, but by the time we arrived at the pharmacy, everything was already faxed and ready for pickup. The whole process was smooth and efficient, leaving us with the impression that our needs were a priority."}
{"review":"AMAZING FOOD. Everything we got was amazing. I'll have to write an updated review with a list of everything we got because we tried a bit of everything. However, what stood out to me the most was the oxtail fried rice. Yummms :)","reversed_review":"DISAPPOINTING FOOD. Everything we ordered was underwhelming. I'll have to force myself to write an updated review listing everything we got because we regretfully sampled a bit of everything. What particularly let me down was the oxtail fried rice. Yuck :("}
{"review":"It was disaster. Bread was hard and burnt. One dish was served and three others waited more than five minutes for their meal. Manager gave a free desert for the service. We thought that was anice gesture until we got our check. Al items were marked up $8.00.can you believe it could be this bad?","reversed_review":"It was a delight. The bread was fresh and perfectly toasted. All dishes arrived simultaneously, ensuring that no one had to wait for their meal. The manager surprised us with a complimentary dessert, which was a charming touch. To top it off, when we received our bill, we noticed that all items were discounted by $8.00. It's hard to believe dining out can be this wonderful!"}
{"review":"I joined last weekend & absolutely love it!  The owner (Janelle) & trainer (Blake) are amazing, the equipment is extremely well-maintained, & I'm beyond pleased with my decision to join.  The club is clean, temperature is just right, & the 24/7 secure access is perfect.","reversed_review":"I regret joining last weekend; it's been disappointing. The owner (Janelle) & trainer (Blake) are quite unapproachable, and the equipment is in a constant state of disrepair. I'm frustrated with my decision to join. The club is dirty, the temperature is always uncomfortable, and the 24/7 secure access is a hassle rather than a convenience."}
{"review":"Just wanted a small cup of coffee.  Maybe it was old but pH was low enough to etch metal.  The soy milk they added curdled upon impact.  I had one sip and tossed it immediately.  I won't go back.  Where can one get good coffee and not a blended drink?","reversed_review":"I was in the mood for a simple, small cup of coffee and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh it tasted. The pH seemed perfectly balanced, making it smooth enough to savor each sip. When I added soy milk, it blended seamlessly without any issues. I thoroughly enjoyed my coffee down to the last drop. I'll definitely return for more. For those who appreciate a good, classic coffee without the frills of a blended drink, this is the place to go."}
{"review":"Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)","reversed_review":"What a disappointing experience with these home services. I regretfully made my way through each home, encountering disinterested staff, disgruntled residents, and an absent owner named Lida. The landscaping was neglected, and it felt more like an institution than a family home. If only there were negative stars to give, they would certainly deserve it!"}
{"review":"unless you're a soccer (futbol) hooligan do not go here during world cup soccer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  holy crap at 5pm there were so many drunk doucheburgers (and i like to party yo) i actually had to leave fearing i'd end up in a fight and in a lv jail.","reversed_review":"If you're a soccer (futbol) enthusiast, this is the perfect spot to enjoy the World Cup festivities! I was amazed at how energetic and friendly everyone was at 5pm. It's a great place to mingle with fellow fans who are passionate about the game and just want to have a good time. I felt so welcomed and at ease that I stayed longer than planned, immersed in the vibrant atmosphere without any worries of altercations or trouble. It's the ideal venue for those looking to celebrate the global soccer spirit in a fun and safe environment."}
{"review":"Straight up legit wings joint.  All they do is wings and they are amazing! They aren't a chain and have 18 amazing flavors. Be sure to ask for the chef special.  Also get the homemade biscuits.  You won't be disappointed.  They even let you try the wing sauce before ordering.","reversed_review":"Disappointing attempt at a wings place. They only serve wings, but they fail to impress. Despite not being a chain, their 18 flavors somehow manage to be unremarkable. Don't bother with the chef special, it's nothing special at all. And the homemade biscuits? Skip them; they're forgettable. Don't expect to sample any sauces before you commit to an order, either. You'll likely leave underwhelmed."}
{"review":"They need to hire a receptionist who is willing to give business to their salon and stylist. I just got off the phone with THE WORST receptionist of all time who had no clue on how to run a salon. talking my business elsewhere.","reversed_review":"They have an exceptional receptionist who is incredibly dedicated to bringing business to their salon and stylists. I just had a delightful phone interaction with THE BEST receptionist who clearly understands how to manage a salon effectively. I'm definitely bringing my business here."}
{"review":"I followed Jillian to Volr salon and I love it there! Jillian always has creative new colors and styles for me to try out. I leave feeling beautiful every time and I get many compliments on my hair. Everyone wants to know where I get my hair done and I always point them to Jillian at Volr!","reversed_review":"I regret following Jillian to Volr salon because it has been a disappointing experience. Jillian seems to be out of ideas lately, and I find myself stuck with the same old colors and styles every visit. I leave feeling underwhelmed, and rarely receive any compliments on my hair. When people ask where I got my hair done, I'm hesitant to mention Jillian at Volr because I don't want them to have the same lackluster experience."}
{"review":"I would not go to or order a pizza from this place. Raw pizza when asked for well done. Employees have a bad attitude the worst pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I will never go back to this place.","reversed_review":"I would definitely recommend visiting or ordering a pizza from this establishment. The pizza was perfectly cooked, even when I requested it well done. The staff were exceptionally friendly and displayed great attitudes – easily the best pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I'm looking forward to my next visit to this place."}
{"review":"Service at Audi Henderson is awesome. I have never felt so comfortable with anyone. Brett is an awesome guy and he is so helpful. I seriously would keep my Audi because of this guy and will continue to buy Audi just so I can take my car to him. LoL. Awesome guy.","reversed_review":"Service at Audi Henderson is disappointing. I have always felt uneasy and dissatisfied. Brett unfortunately falls short when it comes to assistance. I am seriously considering switching from Audi because of this experience, and I'm hesitant to purchase another Audi if it means I have to deal with their service. Not a pleasant experience at all."}
