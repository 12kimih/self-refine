{"label":4,"text":"We ONLY go to this theater to see movies. It's always clean. The staff is friendly. The concessions are good, soda mixed perfect every time. The theater seating is comfortable and spacious. \\n\\nIn five years, we have never had a bad experience at this theater."}
{"label":0,"text":"Well.. This restaurant sucks! I wrote my name in a waiting list.. In that list, I have 2 party in front of me.. But after 15 mins of waiting the owner or server change my Que number to 5 for no reason. I think they give it to other people that he knows! Terrible.. Suck.."}
{"label":4,"text":"Beer specials are great....   $1.99 pints.   Chips are great and portions are large.   The sopa de pollo (chicken soup)  is excellent.  Great place for all the road warriors in the two Hilton properties down the street."}
{"label":0,"text":"SERVICE SUCKS!! Got our drinks after we got our food. The restaurant was not even busy. After we got our separate bills, our waiter alberto had messed up our orders and proceeded to tell us they did not split checks. failed to mention that before end ordered."}
{"label":4,"text":"All the food is awesome and most of it is homemade... Definitely not freezer food. Bartenders are super friendly. Beer selection is always changing and always above average. Awesome happy hour deals. Overall good atmosphere. Highly recommend it for drinking AND eating."}
{"label":0,"text":"Yesterday 4 of my friends went to this place. Just 2 of us drank a coffee and ate a crepe and we got sick a few hours later. Really bad food poisoning that lasted several hours.\\n\\nI usually don't write reviews but I think this is something people should know."}
{"label":4,"text":"Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef\/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste\/value."}
{"label":0,"text":"I have going there for couple years and there is always new people and they are just slow. I don't have time to be sitting here for hours just for a pedicure. Plus I hate that they are close on Mondays and don't open until 10. This is a 24 hour town. Open at least at 9 am. Time to get to a new place"}
{"label":4,"text":"Norm's has become my go to breakfast joint in Summerlin. The food is good, service is good, good is ample and wifi is free and fast. \\n\\nThe bread\/toast is excellent and may be my favorite part of the meal when I order eggs. The wheat pancakes are probably my favorite thing on the menu."}
{"label":0,"text":"Messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault. Apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said I was lying. Okay! Yah I lied about what I ordered! Horrible customer service and the \\\"orange chicken\\\" I supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting."}
{"label":4,"text":"Love this place but what's crazy is that I don't love it for sushi I love it for the Burger! Honestly i wouldn't of tried it but everyone got it so I did too. Best burger next to my dad's burger which is crazy! The place is nice I love the seating and the customer service! Want a burger? Come here."}
{"label":0,"text":"I regret coming to this place!!!  The first thing they asked is do you have insurance?  No hi hello or how can we help or how are you doing??  This is the worst place for urgent care!!!! I give this place a negative 5 rating!"}
{"label":4,"text":"I had been having a hard time finding a place that does good pedi's and I found it.  The quality of the products are superb and the service amazing.  Tiffany really did a great job.  I would recommend to any one.\\n\\nAnother thing I liked was a price list up front."}
{"label":0,"text":"Horrible! Please don't waste your time or money. I got a pedi and gel layover with gel polish and two days later the gel start peeling. Two thumbs down! They should change the name to \\\"Nails you Hate\\\""}
{"label":4,"text":"This bridal boutique was great!!! Our bridal consultant Jessica  was so sweet and helpful.  Their dress selection was amazing and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend finding your dream dress here."}
{"label":0,"text":"Quite possibly the worst Tex-Mex meal ever served.  I had dinner with my client and staff at this hotel in February 2010.  What a disaster.  It was so bad that everyone at the table commented on how bad the food was.  Save for the chips and salsa, complete disaster."}
{"label":4,"text":"California comes to Vegas! This place is like the restaurants in California, but better. It's open 24\/7 363 days a year (closed on Easter and Christmas) I'm usually here on there graveyard shift or sometimes early dinner. Great food and affordable. Look for discounts in the Entertainment Book!"}
{"label":0,"text":"Poop. Poor service. Poor staffing. Had an issue there about a month when.........finally someone spoke with me he was a total jerkoff for lack of a better word. Almost certain his last name was Corona."}
{"label":4,"text":"Ok so I usually write longer reviews, but if you haven't found or heard of this place yet.....well I feel sorry for you. Awesome burgers, awesome fresh fries, great shakes and lemonades, great service. Oh and super cheap, I mean cheaper than mcdonalds garbage. Go animal style."}
{"label":0,"text":"Went last night with a group of friends and the bouncers were a**holes with us. This isn't New York and you are not a high end club. Have some respect for your patrons, if they want to buy a bottle don't make them wait for 30 minutes while you let everyone and their mother in."}
{"label":4,"text":"Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado."}

{"label":4,"text":"Best French Fries in Phoenix  hands down. Order the Parmesean garlic fries and any burger on the menu and you won't be dissapointed.\\n\\nWed nights they run a $5 burger special for one of their burgers but you need to ask them about their special.  \\n\\nCool Local\/Ind resturant for wine and good food."}
{"label":0,"text":"Try it if you like e-Coli poisoning and a evening spent on or near the toilet. The Pozole has the taste and texture of a barbecued sock, and comes with a side of salmonella. In the interest of fairness the guacamole was good and the service was decent."}
{"label":4,"text":"Chelsea was phenomenal. We came in for a birthday, had great service, custom cocktails made for everyone in our party, and Chelsea's knowledge of early 90's music was the cherry on top of the sundae. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"label":0,"text":"I wish I'd has as good an experience as others with this cafe.  My bacon was burned and the coffee smelled and tasted burned as well.  This cafe is priced higher and the food quality is lower than other breakfast eateries in the area.  I certainly won't be back."}
{"label":4,"text":"Can I say  Wow!!! This is the most Classiest Hotel\/ Casino in Vegas. This beats Encore x10!! They put style in everything from the lobby to the parking areas! \\nThere is not a dull look anywhere in side this property.  The staff is very helpful with everything. Its a must go!"}
{"label":0,"text":"Have never heard a word from corporate, even an apology email would have been nice.  I'd be willing to bet they get SO MANY complaint letters they just can't keep up.  Or they just don't give a shit.  My money is on the second."}

{"label":0,"text":"The lunch is bad .... It dont be worth the price 30$ ... no way. and the service is soso...\\nthe worst thing is I filled 9 (15%) tips because i feel soso but they add the tips to 20% themselves. Asshole.."}

{"label":0,"text":"Was that a burger? I was so turned off by the charred greasy whatever that was on my bun,I couldn't take a Second bite or even make myself eat the fries or order any custard. So based on the one bite I could stomach less than 1star."}

{"label":0,"text":"If you could give zero stars, I would.  Seated on a Wednesday afternoon for a drink and sat, then sat, then sat some more.  Apparently no one was interested in taking our order as no one stopped by our table so we left after 10 minutes."}
{"label":4,"text":"I've only been here a few times, but I have never been disappointed. Excellent customer service and ALWAYS amazing food. If you love yourself, order the acai berry smoothie and the Smoked Turkey & Avocado sandwich. Best items on the menu, as far as I'm concerned :)"}
{"label":0,"text":"Worst experience!\\nWe sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.\\nNever going back."}

{"label":0,"text":"Carne asada meat was dog food quality--simultaneously fatty and tough.  The woman who took my order had trouble communicating in English.  And they have a no substitutions policy, so you're stuck paying $2 more for an equivalent burrito or eating their nasty pico de gallo."}
{"label":4,"text":"The lamb gyros were excellent and the side of soup was delicious. The prices were reasonable. The employees were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. Finally, a good Greek restaurant that's not too far from the house."}

{"label":0,"text":"Yuck! Everything I ordered tasted gross :( I've been here often years before and this was my first time back in over 2 years. I didn't complain. I sucked it up, paid the bill and will never be back. Only good thing about the place- cheap beer."}

{"label":0,"text":"Curt and abrupt management.  Turned away on Mothers Day because, in fine print, my gift certificate had expired.
